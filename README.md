- Discord help (for talking)
- Seafarers expansion (fairly easy one)
- Trade negotiations

## Frameworks
### Major
  - **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)** for HTTP server
  - **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)** for WebSocket radio
  - **[VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/)** for Frontend UI

### Minor Libraries
  - [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for rendering JSON data in HTML
  - [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for ease of development
  - [random-words](https://github.com/apostrophecms/random-words) for generating game-keys
  - [cookie-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser) for ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## MapKey DSL Explanation
The map is decoded from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. There can by any amount of space `\s` and newline `\n` inbetween the rows and tiles. They are ignored by `.trim()`.

#### Board
The board consists of `<Rows>` separated by  a `-` (bottom-left) or `+` (bottom-right) representing its tile-relationship to the previous row.
```js
<Row> ([+|-] <Row>)*
```

#### Row
A `<Row>` consists of one or more `<Tile>` separated by dot `.`.
```js
<Tile> (. <Tile>)*
```
There are two types of Tiles - Resource and Sea.

#### Resource Tile
A Resource tile is represented by its key `<TileKey>` and a number `<Number>` next to it.
```js
<TileKey><Number>
```
```js
// Accepted values:
const TileKey = { G: 'Grassland', J: 'Jungle', C: 'Clay Pit', M: 'Mountain', F: 'Fields', S: 'Sea', D: 'Desert' }
const Number = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```

#### Sea Tile
A Sea tile is represented by `S` and can optionally have one trade.
```js
S<Trade>?
```

#### Trade
A `Trade` is represented by its edge of the Sea tile it's on `<tEdge>`, type `<tType>` and a number `<tRatio>` covered by round braces `()` and split by underscore `_`.
```js
(<tEdge>_<tType><tRatio>)
```
```js
// Accepted values:
const tEdge = {
  tl: 'top_left',     tr: 'top_right',
  l: 'left',                                        r: 'right',
              bl: 'bottom_left',  br: 'bottom_right',
}

const tType = { '*': 'All', S: 'Sheep', L: 'Lumber', B: 'Brick', O: 'Ore', W: 'Wheat' }

const tRatio = [2, 3]

// Example: (tr_W3)
```
#### General Note
- Surrounding your land with the sea is not necessary, but recommended to get the beautiful sea shores.
- The robber will be placed in the last desert found during decoding.

### Example
This configuration‚Ä¶
```js
const config = {
  mapkey: `
                        S  .S(bl_O2)    .S(br_O2)    .S
                      -S .M8         .D          .M8   .S
                    -S .G9    .S           .S       .G9  .S
                  -S .F10 .S         .S          .S    .F10.S
                -S  .S .C11   .S           .S       .C12 .S  .S
              -S  .S .S   .C2        .S          .C3   .S  .S  .S
        -S(r_L2).J6.J5 .J4    .S           .S       .J4  .J5 .J6 .S(l_L2)
              +S  .S .S   .S         .S          .S    .S  .S  .S
  `
}
// Same as writing‚Ä¶
config.mapkey = `S.S(bl_O2).S(br_O2).S-S.M8.D.M8.S-S.G9.S.S.G9.S-S.F10.S.S.S.F10.S-S.S.C11.S.S.C12.S.S-S.S.S.C2.S.C3.S.S.S-S(r_L2).J6.J5.J4.S.S.J4.J5.J6.S(l_L2)+S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S`
```
