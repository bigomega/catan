## Future Ideas
- Browser Notifications
- Optimization (memory[^1], speed, colors)
- Join random games
  - Private & public games
- Watch games
- Custom map builder
- Rethink ports
  - multiple in single Sea tile
  - disallow connected edges of land being added as ports
- Introducing 8-player maps
- Social login (w pic and/or just a name/id)
- Discord help (for talking)
- Seafarers expansion (fairly easy one)
- Trade negotiations

## MapKey
### Rules
- The map is decoded from **left-to-right** and **top-to-bottom**.
- Each `row` is separated by a `-` or `+` representing its first-tile relationship to the first-tile of the previous row. `-` makes it bottom-left and `+` for bottom-right.
  ```
  <row> -<row>
  +<row>
  -  <row>
  ```
- There can by any amount of `\s`(space) and `\n`(newline) inbetween the rows and tiles. They are ignored by `.trim()`.
- Each `Tile` is separated by a `.`(dot)
  ```
  <Tile> .<Tile> .   <Tile>
  ```
- A Resource tile is represented by its key and `Number` next to each other. `<TileKey><Number>`
- A Sea tile (represented by `S`) can optionally have one trade. `S(<Trade>)?`
- A `Trade` is represented by its edge `TradeEdge` (of the Sea tile it's on), type `TradeType` and a number `TradeRatio` covered by `()`(round braces) and split by `_`(underscore).
  ```
  (<TradeEdge>_<TradeType><TradeRatio>)
  ```
- Surrounding your land with the sea is not necessary, but recommended to get the beautiful sea shores.
- The robber will be placed in the last desert found during decoding.

#### Keys
```js
const TileKey = { G: 'Grassland', J: 'Jungle', C: 'Clay Pit', M: 'Mountain', F: 'Fields', S: 'Sea', D: 'Desert' }

const Number = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

const tradeEdge = {
              tl: 'top_left',     tr: 'top_right',
  l: 'left',                                        r: 'right',
              bl: 'bottom_left',  br: 'bottom_right',
}

const tradeTyp = { '*': 'All', S: 'Sheep', L: 'Lumber', B: 'Brick', O: 'Ore', W: 'Wheat' }

const tradeRatio = [2, 3]
```

#### Example
This configuration‚Ä¶
```js
const config = {
  mapkey: `
                        S  .S(bl_O2)    .S(br_O2)    .S
                      -S .M8         .D          .M8   .S
                    -S .G9    .S           .S       .G9  .S
                  -S .F10 .S         .S          .S    .F10.S
                -S  .S .C11   .S           .S       .C12 .S  .S
              -S  .S .S   .C2        .S          .C3   .S  .S  .S
        -S(r_L2).J6.J5 .J4    .S           .S       .J4  .J5 .J6 .S(l_L2)
              +S  .S .S   .S         .S          .S    .S  .S  .S
  `
}
// Same as writing‚Ä¶
config.mapkey = `S.S(bl_O2).S(br_O2).S-S.M8.D.M8.S-S.G9.S.S.G9.S-S.F10.S.S.S.F10.S-S.S.C11.S.S.C12.S.S-S.S.S.C2.S.C3.S.S.S-S(r_L2).J6.J5.J4.S.S.J4.J5.J6.S(l_L2)+S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S`
```
