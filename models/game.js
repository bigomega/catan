/**
 * -------
 * RULES
 * -------
 *
 * Max - 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads.
 *
 * You may only play 1 development card during your turnâ€” either 1 knight card or 1 progress card. You can play the card at any time, even before you roll the dice. You may not, however, play a card that you bought during the same turn.
 *
 * Yes. You can build the settlement in the middle of an opponent's road (as long as your   own road connects to it and there is at least one gap before any other existing settlements).
 *
 * Yes. It does affect the longest road: the road stops at the settlement for counting purposes, and starts again at the other side.
 *
 * Yes. Both players who possess roads into an intersection have the option of building the third road out, regardless of whether a settlement is there or whose it is.
